This project is created using ReactJS
Some important things to note is that
-> To remove filter box from screen tap on filter again
-> To remove city/state filter previously selected just select the default option(Choose a city/state )
-> Here I have taken date of user as 18th March,2022 as user date was not specified in the api and if I go with current date then I am having no upcoming ride as all ride has date before today
-> There is also an error page for error in fetching data

Looking forward to get the internship oppurtunity in your company
Thanks
